<center><h1>About Me</h1>
<h2 class="About_me_name">Cathlynne Lee "Cathy" Eustaquio</h2></center><br>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
  Cathy was raised in San Jose Del Monte, a city in Bulacan near Metro Manila, and is the second child of Mr. and Mrs. Petronio Eustaquio. She earned her Bachelor's degree in Elementary Education from Cainta Catholic College in 2014 and immediately began her career as a teacher at a Catholic school in Cainta.

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
  After teaching and serving as a Classroom Adviser for two school years, Cathy decided to enter the call center industry and worked with Expert Global Solutions (now Alorica). There, she honed her communication skills, particularly in speaking with native North American citizens, customer service, multitasking, and interpersonal skills. After handling live frontline calls for over 1 year and 4 months, Cathy sought to learn more and left Alorica to find a company specializing in non-voice accounts. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
  Fortunately, she found Convergys (acquired by Concentrix in 2018) and worked with them for 7 months on a contractual basis as a Chat Support Representative for a shoe company. She sharpened her multitasking skills, managing a minimum of two chat conversations simultaneously. A significant part of her job involved locating shoes that were no longer available on the company’s website but could still be found at other legitimate stores like Footlocker and Finish Line.


<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
  Following her contractual project with Convergys, Cathy decided to start a small business with her family. They experimented with various products to sell, including puto (pudding) in flavors like mais, Kitkat, Toblerone, and Buko-pandan. She also crafted handmade bracelets, keychains, and necklaces as souvenirs. Cathy explored the world of virtual assistance by reading related books, building her own website on Blogspot using HTML skills learned in high school. These experiences proved valuable, but with encouragement from her relatives and a growing desire to return to teaching, she took the Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET) in September 2018. Unfortunately, it was not her time.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
  She then enrolled in a review center to refresh her expertise in education and successfully passed the LET in March 2019. Cathy was hired as a new teacher at Siena College of San Jose in Bulacan, where she taught Filipino to Grades 1 to 3. It was a rewarding school year, as her advisory class frequently received awards for good conduct and classroom cleanliness.

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
  In 2019, Moodle was introduced to SCSJ by Phoenix Publishing House, branded as "Aralinks" (a blend of "Aral," the Tagalog word for "study," and "links," referring to software links). Cathy enjoyed using HTML and exploring Moodle’s features for quizzes, exams, and group activities. However, the pandemic arrived, necessitating a transition to remote teaching.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
  During this period, Cathy continued teaching from home and enrolled in a Master’s program in Distance Education at the University of the Philippines Open University, anticipating its future benefits. In 2021, she launched an online coffee business named "Timpla Pinas," which became her most successful business endeavor. She fulfilled numerous orders through Shopee until 2022.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
  For many, the pandemic was a challenging time, but for Cathy, it was a golden era for her teaching career. Her technological skills made online teaching easy and engaging, leading her to be recognized as one of the Blended Learning Proponents by Phoenix Publishing House in 2021. By the 2021-2022 school year, she was promoted as the MAPEH Area Team Leader. She held this role for a year before resigning from teaching on May 31, 2022.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">In October 2022, Cathy joined Shopify, one of the world’s leading e-commerce platforms. She was thrilled to combine her interest in online stores and web development, and she explored reviving her online coffee business. At Shopify, she learned to design websites using themes and templates, set up online businesses, implement automations, and integrate third-party software. This overwhelming experience helped her realize her true calling in web development.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Cathy discovered a wealth of knowledge about Shopify, motivating her to learn more. She enrolled in Udemy online courses and bootcamps to deepen her understanding of web design and development. Her prior HTML knowledge proved advantageous as she created her own designs using HTML and CSS, and continued learning JavaScript and other programming tools. These skills are invaluable for troubleshooting and resolving web design issues.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Cathy remains with Shopify, working across various lines of business and departments. She previously served as a Blended Merchant Support Advisor for 22 months, handling live chats, phone calls, and emails. She now works as part of the Technical Merchant Support Team and is also exploring virtual assistance with her expanded experience and knowledge.</p>
